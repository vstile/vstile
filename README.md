# Vittorio Stile &mdash; @vstile

## 😎 About Me
Hey there! I’m Vittorio Stile, a Chartered Engineer and a massive IT enthusiast. I’ve got a Ph.D. in the works, an M.Sc. in Business Engineering "Cum Laude," and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering under my belt. I spend my days juggling roles as an Innovation Manager, Product Manager, and UX Designer, with a keen focus on making mobile devices and human-machine interfaces as user-friendly as possible. Besides all that techy stuff, I teach courses on Industry 4.0, diving deep into Human-Machine Interaction and Blockchain. 

I work at the intersection of applied AI, education, and human centered systems, with a strong focus on reproducible research and clear documentation.

What really revs my engine? Innovating and optimizing every sector I touch. I’m all about building lasting, win-win partnerships with the companies I work with—not just racking up a long list of clients. Let’s make something great together!

## 👨‍💻 Coding... but I am not a coder!
I am a certified iOS developer from the Apple Developer Academy of Napoli. I enjoy reading and learning about the latest technologies and frameworks to better collaborate, as Product Manager & UX Designer, with development teams. I can support front-end development in Xcode, create FileMaker projects from scratch, and I know the basics of C programming.

I also use Python for DeepFake detection projects in Computer Vision, mainly working on Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code. For me, the language is not the key point — the goal is. I do not consider myself a programmer, but I always keep up with the latest trends, frameworks, and tools, and if I need to implement even complex tasks (API configuration, JSON handling, ML models, or R code for data science), I can manage them without problems.

So... I can code but don't offer me jobs as a coder. I don't want to work as a coder, I do it for passion and for academic/research purposes.

## What you’ll find here
- **Deepfake detection research**: attribute aware pipelines, bias and error analysis, and replication ready notebooks (see `deepfake-attribute-detection`).  
- **Literature review tooling**: an end to end protocol and datasets for a deepfake detection PhD review, including query sets and de duplication workflow (see `00-deepfake-detection-review`).
- **Teaching and demos**: compact CNN baselines and classic datasets such as MNIST and AT&T/Olivetti, designed to be easy to run and explain (`01-binary-classification`, `02-digit-classification-mnist`, `03-face-classification-olivetti` and `04-deepfake-detection`). 
- **Applied data workflows**: notebooks and scripts for education and ML analysis (`2025edu4ai`).

## Tech stack
`Python`, `Jupyter`, `TensorFlow`/`Keras`, `OpenCV`, `scikit learn`, `Swift`, `C`, and `LaTeX` for research writing.

## Collaboration
I’m happy to connect with researchers and educators working on trustworthy AI, computer vision, and reproducible ML experiments.
