## 👨‍💻 Coding... just for fun!
I am a certified iOS developer from the Apple Developer Academy of Napoli, I like to read and learn about the latest technologies and frameworks in order to better collaborate, as UX Designer, with the development team. I can help the team on front-end development in Xcode, I can develop FileMaker projects starting from scratch and I know the basics of C programming. 

So... I can code but don't offer me jobs as a coder. I don't want to work as a coder, I do it for passion and for fun and I prefer to leave it to others who do it better than me.
