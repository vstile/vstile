## 😎 About Me
Hey there! I’m Vittorio Stile, a Chartered Engineer and a massive IT enthusiast. I’ve got a Ph.D. in the works, an M.Sc. in Business Engineering "Cum Laude," and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering under my belt. I spend my days juggling roles as an Innovation Manager, Product Manager, and UX Designer, with a keen focus on making mobile devices and human-machine interfaces as user-friendly as possible. Besides all that techy stuff, I teach courses on Industry 4.0, diving deep into Human-Machine Interaction and Blockchain. 

What really revs my engine? Innovating and optimizing every sector I touch. I’m all about building lasting, win-win partnerships with the companies I work with—not just racking up a long list of clients. Let’s make something great together!

## 👨‍💻 Coding... but I am not a coder!
I am a certified iOS developer from the Apple Developer Academy of Napoli. I enjoy reading and learning about the latest technologies and frameworks to better collaborate, as Product Manager & UX Designer, with development teams. I can support front-end development in Xcode, create FileMaker projects from scratch, and I know the basics of C programming.

I also use Python for DeepFake detection projects in Computer Vision, mainly working on Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code. For me, the language is not the key point — the goal is. I do not consider myself a programmer, but I always keep up with the latest trends, frameworks, and tools, and if I need to implement even complex tasks (API configuration, JSON handling, ML models, or R code for data science), I can manage them without problems.

So... I can code but don't offer me jobs as a coder. I don't want to work as a coder, I do it for passion and for academic/research purposes.
